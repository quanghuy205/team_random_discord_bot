    I used this post to help fix a bug in which members
    were not found in voice channels due to not having the 
    members intent enabled.
    '''
    intents = discord.Intents().default()
    intents.members = True
    botInfo = discord.Activity(type=discord.ActivityType.watching, name = "for sự thay đổi của Fong một cách bớt đần độn!")
    client = commands.Bot(command_prefix = "!", activity = botInfo, help_command = None, intents = intents, reconnect = True)
    return client

def getDB():
    keyPath = os.path.join("tokens","firebaseKey.json")

    print(keyPath)
    cred = credentials.Certificate(keyPath)
    firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)
    db = firestore.client()
    return db
